# LISSU: Integrating SemanticWeb Concepts Into SOA Frameworks
Resource repository accompanying the research paper "LISSU: Integrating Semantic Web Concepts Into SOA Frameworks" from the [International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS)](http://www.iceis.org/), covering code snippets and an example.

## Implementation

Prerequisites:
- `bazel`

Find out how to install it here: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html

Run `bazel run //implementation/services/semanticservice:main` from inside this folder.



## Usage of the Semantic Services 

### Related file locations
Under /implementation/services/semanticservice you can find the "main.py" file containing the two new semantic service implementations and the semantic configurations for the servers as well. The server configurations should be named after the server. 

The services are defined under "proto/semanticservice/semanticservice.proto"  

So far only tested with the scanner service. Under "services/scannerservice/hardwarecontroller/semanticDemos" the "withSem.py" file can be used as a test for both semantic modules in an error free environment and the "failedSem.py" file for a case with semantical errors. 

The "clientSemantic.json" is a configuration file with the OM URIs while "qudtSemantic.json" has the QUDT identifiers. 

### Developing new client applications 
Applications can be written as they were before but every client will have to include its semantic via a configuration file in JSON.  
Connect to the semantic service first and do the semantic check with the required arguments (can be found in the Protobuf definition of the semantic service). 
Add the unit variables that can also be found in the corresponding proto definitions to a dictionary (or a similar data structure) with their names from the proto file as their key and their value in your client application. This can later be used for the conversion service. 

### Runing applications with semantics enabled 
1) Run the semantic server in this folder via "bazel run main".  

2) Run a desired server, for example the scanner mockup under "services/scannerservice/hardwarecontroller/mockup" via "bazel run mockup" 

3) Start your desired client, for example the demo client under "services/scannerservice/hardwarecontroller/semanticDemos" via "bazel run withSem"
